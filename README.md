# Alt Three Segment

A [Segment](https://segment.com/) bridge for Laravel 5.


## Installation

This version requires [PHP](https://php.net) 7.1 or 7.2, and supports Laravel 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7.

To get the latest version, simply require the project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
$ composer require alt-three/segment
```

Once installed, if you are not using automatic package discovery, then you need to register the  `AltThree\Segment\SegmentServiceProvider` service provider in your `config/app.php`.


## Configuration

Alt Three Segment requires configuration.

To get started, you'll need to publish all vendor assets:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

This will create a `config/segment.php` file in your app that you can modify to set your configuration. Also, make sure you check for changes to the original config file in this package between releases.


## Usage

Once you've set your `write_key` value in the configuration, you're ready to go! For the most part you can follow [Segments own instructions](https://segment.com/docs/libraries/php/quickstart) however, you'll want to replace the `Analytics` classname with `Segment` - plus, you don't need to call `class_alias`.

### Identify the user

```php
Segment::identify([
    "userId" => "12345abcde",
    "traits" => [
        "name"  => "James Brooks",
        "email" => "test@test.com",
    ]
]);
```

### Track actions

```php
Segment::track([
    "userId"     => "12345abcde",
    "event"      => "Did something",
    "properties" => [
        "was_awesome" => true,
    ]
]);
```
